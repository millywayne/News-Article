     <p>There was hullabaloo and pandemonium in Kawangware as a fire-breathing dragon was spotted in the early hours of the morning. It was first spotted by Nyambeki, a resident in the area, who claimed it tore after her. As it is Kenyan culture to run towards danger,instead of away from it, residents from  from the area and around it ran to get to witness this historic event not remembering that dragons are actually exinct.</p>

    <p>I rushed there with my camera crew to our amazement,we found out that Mr.Brown, a mzungu resident in the area was preparing for halloween party in his home and so he had asked a local Jua-kali artisan to build him a metalic dragon as part of the decoration for his party and the smoke tha Nymbeki had seen was actually a jiko that was put there to help there to help the scupture dry in time for the party. Below is an image of what we found on reaching there. </p>
